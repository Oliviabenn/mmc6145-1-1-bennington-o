                <p>I am a graduate student at the University of Florida studying Web Design and development. Originally from New York, I have a background in theatrical design and production with most of my professional expereince in the theater. I began studying Web Design with the intent of broadening my skills and exploring my interest in technology and the ways it affects our society. This semester we will be practicing how to create Single-Page Applications and client-side rendering in modern front-end web development. Objectives for this semester include gaining an understanding of the various options available when constructing full-stack applications, as well as the serverless architecture used to deploy and host them <i>(via course description on Canva)</i>.</p>
